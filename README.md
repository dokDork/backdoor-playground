3 projects have been created that can be opened directly with visual studio code:
- **reverseshell**: This project creates a simple reverse shell that is not detected by antivirus software.
- **reverseShell-dll**: This project generates the reverse shell code within a DLL and injects it into the notepad.exe process. If the process does not exist, it automatically creates it.
- **reverseShell-rust**: This project **can inject the code of a reverse shell created with msfvenom** into the notepad.exe process. Again, if the process does not exist, it will be created automatically.
